# Treats Sweet Shop
Treats Sweet Shop is a e-commerce website that I build using the Django Full Stack Framework for my fifth and final project in Full Stack Development at Code Institute.
Treats Sweet Shop is a online sweet store where users can purchase sweets from a wide variety of products, there is also a section on the website that allows users to leave reviews of their experience shopping at Treats. I have also included a blog section where the admin can post a blog and then registered users are able to comment underneath said blogs.

### Agile Methodology
Github projects was used to track the development of this website using the agile approach, the project can be found [here](https://github.com/users/kpsdev1/projects/6).

### Typography
- The font that was used for the logo was **Ysabeau**.
- **Montserrat** font was used for the body.

### Colour Scheme
For this site I decide to keep the main color scheme very simple, with the text being black or grey. The logo and the login/ logout page headings in green. I did also have some buttons like the delete, cancel, edit and post buttons red, orange and blue but the main color scheme of the site was black, white, grey and green.

## Marketing
Treats Sweet Shop is a e-commerce website that sells directly to consumers all over the world. It is a B2C focused webite, and the idea of the site is to be able to bring affordable sweets to people all over the world. We have tried to create an easy shopping experience for the users so that they are able to navigate and purchase products quickly and with ease. 


#### Social Media Marketing
As the budget is limited with this business we decided to use cheap organic marketing to start with and maybe in the future when business takes off we will look into some paid advertising. With all this in mind we decided to start with creating a Facebook Business page as Facebook is one of the biggest social media sites and one of the best for promoting a business. By creating a Facebook business page we then could post regular content of what we offer to keep the audience engaged. We have also decided on our Facebook page, to do monthly sweet hamper giveaways where the users just need to follow our page and share the post, this in turn is also a cheap way that we can advertise our business. The Facebook page can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100094215246991). (please note Facebook may have removed this page as they tend to remove inactive pages so I have included a screenshot below)


![Facebook Page](readme-docs/images/facebook.jpg)  

#### Email Marketing
We also plan to send out a monthly news letter that details what products we have to offer and any new products that we may have on the site, as the site is still growing we will be constantly adding more and more products. In order to collect emails for our monthly mailing list we have added a suscribe inpupt field at the bottom of page in the footer where the user can enter their email address and then click suscribe, which will then sign them up to our monthly news letter. We used mailchimp to collect our mailing list.

#### Search Engine Optimization
For this project I completed research on which SEO keywords to use both short-tail(which are more broad generic and popular search terms ) and long-tail(which are keywords that are more specific, niche, and targeted terms that have a lower search volume and competition) in order to improve the search engine ranking so that our site will be more visible to people online.

#### Sitemap.xml
To help search engines crawl through our website a sitemap was created with a list of all the important urls and data on the site. We used XML sitemaps.com to create our sitemap.The website can be found [here](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

#### Robots.txt
A robots.txt file was created to tell search engines where not to go on the site.

## Features

### Navigation Bar
- The Navigation bar sits at the very top of each page, The logo is at the left hand side and the navigation links are then to the left of the center of the page with the search, login/ register and shopping cart to the right hand side.

## Future Features
- In the future I would like to add more products to the site and maybe also add some soft drinks so that users could order sweeets and drinks.
- I would also like a implememnt a stock monitoring system for the site admins so they would know how much of each product that they have and also when they would need to order more of a certain product, although at the momemnt I'm not so sure as to which would be the best way to tackle this.

## Testing
The testing section can be found [here](TESTING.md).

## Deployment
This website is deployed to Heroku from a github repository, the following steps were taken:

#### Creating Respository on Github
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

#### Creating app on Heroku
- After creating the repository on github, head over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
- On the home page, click **New** and **Create new app** from the drop down.
- Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a **region** I chose **Europe** as I am in Europe, Then click **Create app**.

#### Create a database On ElephantSQL
- Log into the [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) website and click **Create new Instance**
- Enter a **Name** and keep the plan as **Tiny Turtle Free**, the **tags** field can be left blank, Select a region closest to you, I selected **EU-West-1(Ireland)** as I'm in Ireland. Then click **Review** and afterwards click **create instance**.
- On The Dashboard click on your database instance name.
- You will see the details for your database instance, in the url section click on the copy icon to copy the database url.
- Head over to gitpod and create a **Database URL** enviroment variable in your env.py file and set it equal to the copied url.

#### Deploying to Heroku.
- Head back over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and click on your **app** and then go to the **Settings tab**
- On the **settings page** scroll down to the **config vars** and enter your key and value pairs.
- Then scroll to the top and go to the **deploy tab** and go down to the **Deployment method** section and select **Github** and then sign into your account.
- Below that in the **search for a repository to connect to** search box enter the name of your repository that you created on **github** and click **connect**
- Once it has connected scroll down to the **Manual Deploy** and click **Deploy branch** when it has deployed you will see a **view app** button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
- Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.

- Django For Beginners book, This is a book that I would recommend to everyone who wants to learn Django, this made me understand how to create simple class based views. The first 4 chapters can be read [here](https://djangoforbeginners.com/introduction/).
- Code Institutes **Boutique Ado** walk through project was a great help, as it really gave me a way to structure a project and then build off it, I would have been totally lost without this.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is probably a developers best resource, this provided me with many answers to my questions.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) this was great for looking up forgotten **CSS** and syntax and how to use it.
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) all images were take from unsplash.
- [30secondsofcode](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/articles/s/css-footer-at-the-bottom) showed me how to keep the footer at the bottom of the page.
